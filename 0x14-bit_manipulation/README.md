# 0x14-bit_manipulation

  By bit manipulation we mean the proccess that made to the data in the bit level.
  There are many bit-wise operators in most of the programming langauges, in C we have the `bit-wise AND` (`&`), `bit-wise OR` (`|`), `bit-wise XNOR` (`^`) and the `complement` (`~`), beside the left-shifting `<<` and the right-shifting `>>`.
  Here in this project we will work throught how the `Bit-Wise`'s can be implemented in a real code. All the codes below are using one or more of `bit-wise` operators to get the job done.

## 0-binary_to_uint.c

   Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int

## 1-print_binary.c

   Fnction that prints the binary representation of a number.

## 2-get_bit.c

   Function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

## 3-set_bit.c

   Function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

## 4-clear_bit.c

   Function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

## 5-flip_bits.c

   Function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
