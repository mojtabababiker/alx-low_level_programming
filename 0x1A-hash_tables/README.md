# Hash Table

  ### Hash table is a Data Structure in which the Data is represented as `Key` `Value`. There are many ways a `Hash Table` can be implemented, but here we are using a `C` struct with an array of pointers that point to the hashed nodes and the size elemnts which represents the size of the array

  ## Hash Table Complexity:

     ### Time Complexity:

     1. Creating the Hash Table is `O(N)`

     2. Inserting to the Hash Table is `O(1)`

     3. Deletion is `O(1)`

     4. Accessing is `O(1)`

     ### Memory Complexty:

     1. Creating the Hash Table is `O(1)`

     2. Inserting to the Hash Table is `O(1)`

     3. Deletion is `O(1)`

     4. Accessing is `O(1)`
